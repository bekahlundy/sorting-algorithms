# Array Challenges Day 1

## Stations

There will be 4 stations.

Station 1: - Pair programming on station-1 array challenges.

Station 2: - Pair programming on station-2 array challenges.

Station 3: Whiteboard challenge with Brenna as a group

Station 4: White board challenge with Taylor as a group

Group 1: Start at Station 1
Group 2: Start at Station 2
Group 3: Start at Station 3
Group 4: Start at Station 4

Groups will be dropped into Slack.

## Instructions

Read the questions file associated with the station you are at. Write a test fulfilling the criteria for the question, and then write implementation in the appropriate file to make the test pass.

## CAVEATS:

*MUST* Use Driver-Navigator pairing method.

This means one person is speaking, the other person is coding.

You are **STRONGLY ENCOURAGED** to practice the "bastard implementation" style of Driver-Navigator. This means that if I am the navigator and I tell my driver "Ok let's create a variable", the driver should code the line `var`. This is an exercise to use correct and explicit vocabulary to solve a problem.

Feel free to talk through solutions in an abstract way and mess around with the console/docs before starting to write real code. Once the real coding begins - kick off bastard implementation driver-navigator.

Whoever is the driver for Station 1, switch to act as the navigator at Station 2.
